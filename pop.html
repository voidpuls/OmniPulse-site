    <h1>Omnipulse Bot - Privacy Policy</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Effective Date: 10/16/2024</h2>
        <p>At Omnipulse, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in how we collect, use, and share your information while using the Omnipulse Bot (referred to as "the Bot"). This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the handling of user data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We may collect the following data when you interact with the Bot:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Server Information:</strong> We collect basic information about the Discord servers where the Bot is used, including server ID, name, and user roles.</li>
            <li><strong>User Information:</strong> We may collect user IDs and Discord usernames for moderation purposes or when specific bot commands are used (e.g., reporting violations).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No sensitive personal information (such as email addresses or real names) is collected by the Bot.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Use of Data</h2>
        <p>The data we collect is used solely to provide the Bot’s services and features, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Moderation and enforcement of server rules.</li>
            <li>Handling reports of abuse or misuse of the Bot.</li>
            <li>Improving Bot functionality and performance.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Sharing of Data</h2>
        <p>We will not share or sell your data to third parties. However, we may share limited data with Discord for enforcement purposes if we detect or are made aware of any misuse of the Bot that violates Discord’s Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.</p>
        <p>Additionally, in cases where reports of abuse are submitted, we may provide a temporary 1-day, one-use Discord invite link to allow you to join our support server for further review and discussion. This invite is issued strictly for report handling purposes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain user and server information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy. If you remove the Bot from your server, all associated data will be deleted within 30 days unless otherwise required for legal or compliance reasons.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss. However, we cannot guarantee complete security, and users are encouraged to ensure their own server's security as well.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to request the removal or modification of any personal data collected by the Bot. You can do this by contacting us through our support server or using the provided reporting commands within the Bot.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>Omnipulse reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be communicated through updates to the Bot or posted on our official website. Continued use of the Bot following such updates constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
